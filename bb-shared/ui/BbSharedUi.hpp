/*
 * bb-shared / ui / BbSharedUi.hpp - one place that registers bb-shared's QML UI types. The app calls
 * bbshared::registerUiTypes() ONCE at startup (before loading QML that uses them) and then writes
 * `import bb.shared 1.0` in its QML. This copy registers only the types Tweaker uses.
 *
 * GUI-only (needs Cascades / QtDeclarative). bb-shared.pri compiles the ui/ part only under CONFIG += bb_shared_ui.
 *
 * SharedClipboard (the "Buy me a coffee" card's copy button) is registered only when the app also has
 * CONFIG += bb_shared_coffee, which defines BBSHARED_COFFEE and compiles it.
